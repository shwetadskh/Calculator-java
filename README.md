Create a Custom Class:



Create a Java Calculator Class that does the following five commands:
An add method that takes in two integer numbers and adds them together the call to that method would look like this: add(int num1, int num2)
A subtraction method that takes in two integers and subtracts them from one another would look like this: subtract( int num1, int num2)
A multiplication method that takes in two integer numbers and multiplies them together the call to that method would look like this: multiply(int num1, int num2)
A division method that takes in two integer numbers and divides them the call to that method would look like this: divide(int num1, int num2)
A square method that takes in one integer and squares it: square(int num1)
Create a MagicCalculator that inherits its basic functionality from your calculator and does the following functions:
Finds the square root of a number
Finds the sin (trigonometry) of a number. [Note: Feel free to use the MATH class]
Finds the cosine (trigonometry) of a number. [Note: Feel free to use the MATH class]
Finds the tangent (trigonometry) of a number. [Note: Feel free to use the MATH class]
Finds the factorial (!) of the number
